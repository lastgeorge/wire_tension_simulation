1. calc.C
    Calculation of two wires

2. calc_multiple.C
    Calculation of a single plane (15 wires) above a ground plane
    We assume the plane has a fixed voltage ...

3. test.C  (3 electrode)
   toy to test the idea of different potential ...

4. test1.C (3 electrode)
   same as test.C, but trying to include a realsitic calculation of L

5. test2.C (full model)

6. plot_current.C
   Simulate waveform
   Also can swing the potential in a plane etc.
